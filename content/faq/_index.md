      - title: Do I need to tell my employer
        content: |
          Usually no. KiwiSaver contributions are sent through payroll to Inland Revenue, so they will continue automatically after you switch providers.

          You only need to tell your employer if you want to change your contribution rate.

      - title: Do you recommend funds that do not pay you?
        content: |
          Yes, sometimes. If a fund meets our analysis criteria and is on our recommended list, we can recommend it even if the provider does not pay us. In those cases, you may need to complete the join or switch directly on the provider’s website.

          Your KiwiSaver fund fees are charged by the provider. BetterSaver may be paid by some providers if you join through us, and this does not add an extra fee to you. We explain how we are paid and any conflicts in our Disclosure Statement.

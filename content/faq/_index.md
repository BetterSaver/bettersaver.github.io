      - title: What does BetterSaver cost?
        content: |
          There is no cost to you for our KiwiSaver advice.

          We are paid by some KiwiSaver providers whose funds we recommend. If you choose a recommended fund that does not pay us, we will not receive payment.

      - title: Can I switch KiwiSaver providers at any time
        content: |
          Yes. You can switch whenever you want.
        include_in_faq: true
      - title: Do I need to tell my employer?
        content: |
          Usually no. KiwiSaver contributions are sent through payroll to Inland Revenue, so they will continue automatically after you switch providers.

          You only need to tell your employer if you want to change your contribution rate.

      - title: How long does switching take?
        content: |
          Often a few business days. Sometimes it takes longer, depending on the providers involved and whether any extra checks are needed.

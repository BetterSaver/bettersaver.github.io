# Recommended KiwiSaver funds

Our shortlist, published for transparency

## Advice first

Most people do not want a list of funds. They want to know they are in the right one.

This page shows the funds we currently recommend, plus the funds we track that are not currently recommended and why. We publish it so you can see what sits behind our advice.

If you want the best fit for you, get a recommendation. The right fund depends on your timeframe, how you feel about ups and downs, and any preferences you have about how your money is invested.

## The four categories on this page

1. **Our recommended funds**

   These are the funds we are comfortable advising clients into today, based on our criteria.
2. **Funds not currently recommended because they do not meet our criteria**

   These are funds we track and assess, but they do not meet our standards right now. That might be because of performance versus peers, fees versus value, consistency, downside risk, or quality checks.
3. **Funds not currently recommended due to insufficient data**

   Some funds are too new, have limited history, or have gaps in the information we rely on. Until we have enough reliable data, we will not recommend them.
4. **Funds not currently recommended because they are too narrowly focused**

   These funds are concentrated in a single sector or theme. That can mean bigger swings and less diversification. KiwiSaver is usually a long term core investment, so we generally do not recommend narrowly focused funds as a main KiwiSaver option.

## Our recommended funds

Funds are grouped by risk type. A Growth fund should not be compared to a Conservative fund.

If you are not sure which risk type is right for you, start with a recommendation and we will guide you.

Lower risk, typically more cash and bonds. Best suited to shorter timeframes.

#### &#xA;Commissions and independence

BetterSaver may receive a commission from some KiwiSaver providers if you join or switch into their fund through our platform. This does not increase your fund fees.

Commissions do not influence our analysis or our recommendations. In practice, there are more funds from providers we could be paid for that do not make our recommended list than there are funds on our recommended list. That is because the list is driven by our criteria, not commercial arrangements.

Where we do recommend a provider’s funds, we aim to have a commercial agreement in place so we can keep improving the service for you, including smoother switching, better support, and better tools over time.

If a provider does not support switching through our platform, you may need to complete your signup or switch directly on the provider’s website. We will make that clear before you proceed.

## Important information

BetterSaver is a licensed Financial Advice Provider (FSP 600609). Our advice is based on the information you provide and the information available about each fund at the time.

All investing involves risk. KiwiSaver values can go up and down. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance.

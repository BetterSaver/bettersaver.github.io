##### **Helping Kiwis make better KiwiSaver decisions — clearly, fairly, and with your best interests at heart.**

This Disclosure Statement is provided by BetterSaver Limited in accordance with the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. It explains how we work, how we’re paid, and your rights when receiving financial advice from us.

##### &#xA;**Who we are**

BetterSaver Limited (FSP 600609) is a licensed Financial Advice Provider. We help Kiwis make smarter KiwiSaver choices

##### **&#xA;The advice we give**

We only give financial advice about KiwiSaver. This includes:

•	Recommending KiwiSaver funds that match your goals, values, and risk profile

•	Explaining your options and helping you make informed decisions

•	Handling the switch to your new provider if you choose to move.

We do not provide advice about other investments, insurance, or lending products. Our advice may be personalised (specific to you) or class advice (general KiwiSaver guidance that does not take your circumstances into account).

##### &#xA;**How we work**

BetterSaver reviews all KiwiSaver providers and all KiwiSaver funds in the market. We analyse more than 300 funds using independent data and our own rating methodology, considering factors such as returns, risk, fees, sustainability, and volatility.

Based on this analysis, we maintain a recommended fund list.

A fund may appear on our recommended list whether or not the provider pays us, provided it meets our fund analysis criteria. Our advice is based on fund quality and suitability for your goals and risk level, not on whether the provider pays us.

If a fund does not appear on our recommended list, it will be because either:

•	the fund did not meet our analysis criteria and is not recommended, or

•	there is not enough reliable data available for us to assess and recommend the fund.

##### **&#xA;Ongoing advice and implementation**

If you choose a recommended fund from a provider we have a commercial agreement with, we are able to:

•	complete the signup and transfer process for you through our platform

•	provide ongoing advice and support, including contribution guidance and fund reviews

•	continue monitoring your fund and make recommendations over time.

If you choose a recommended fund from a provider that does not pay us:

•	we can still provide advice on whether the fund is suitable for you

•	we will explain how you can join that fund directly through the provider’s website

•	however, we are not able to provide ongoing advice, monitoring, or implementation services for that fund.

This difference reflects the scope of services we are funded to provide, not the quality of the fund itself.

##### **&#xA;How we get paid**

If you choose a fund from a provider we have a commercial agreement with, that provider pays us a commission. This is usually an upfront payment when you join and an ongoing annual payment while you remain in that fund. These payments do not increase the fees you pay your KiwiSaver provider.

If you choose a recommended fund from a provider that does not pay us, we will not receive any payment for that advice.

A list of the providers we work with and the remuneration they pay us is available on request.

##### **&#xA;Managing conflicts of interest**

Because we are paid by some KiwiSaver providers, we have processes in place to ensure our advice is always based on your best interests.

Our advisers do not receive bonuses or incentives for recommending one provider or fund over another.

To manage potential conflicts, we have:

•	A consistent, data-driven fund rating and recommendation process

•	Regular internal audits and compliance checks

•	Adviser training and monitoring

•	A clear separation between commercial agreements and advice decisions.

##### **&#xA;Our duties to you**

The law requires us to:

•	Give priority to your interests

•	Exercise care, diligence, and skill

•	Ensure our advice is suitable for you

•	Meet the standards of competence, knowledge, and skill required by the Code of Professional Conduct for Financial Advice Services

•	Meet the standards of ethical behaviour, conduct, and client care required by the Code of Professional Conduct for Financial Advice Services.

##### **&#xA;What it costs you**

There is no cost to you for our KiwiSaver advice.

We are paid by some KiwiSaver providers whose funds we recommend. If you choose a recommended fund that does not pay us, we will not receive payment.

##### **&#xA;Complaints and disputes**

If you are unhappy with our service, please contact us first so we can try to resolve the issue.

When we receive a complaint, we will acknowledge it promptly and investigate the issue fairly and independently. We aim to respond to complaints as soon as reasonably practicable and keep you informed of progress while we do so. We keep records of all complaints and the steps taken to resolve them.

If we cannot resolve the issue to your satisfaction, you can contact Financial Services Complaints Limited (FSCL), our independent dispute resolution scheme. This service is free for you to use.

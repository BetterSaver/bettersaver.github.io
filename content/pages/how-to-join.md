# How to join and switch KiwiSaver providers

#### This page is here to make switching simple.

It explains what happens when you join KiwiSaver, what happens when you switch providers, and what BetterSaver does at each step. The aim is to help you move to a better fit without stress or paperwork.

#### Join BetterSaver. Find a better fund. Switch online.

We ask a few quick questions, show you a shortlist of recommended options, then guide you through the switch. You stay in control the whole time.

## How it works

#### Step 1  We confirm what matters for you

We ask a few quick questions about your timeframe, how you feel about ups and downs, and any preferences around how your money is invested. The aim is to make sure the recommendation fits you, not just your age.

#### Step 2  We show your recommended options

We show a fund that matches your profile and meets our analysis criteria. You can compare it against other funds side by side, in plain English. The aim is to help you make a clear decision without noise.

#### Step 3  We help you join or switch

You can complete an application to join or switch on our website. We capture all the required information and pass it on to your chosen provider to finish the join or switch. The aim is to keep the process smooth either way.

## What you will need

Most people can do this in 5 minutes. Having these handy helps.

* Email and mobile number
* IRD number (helpful, not always required upfront)
* A form of ID for online verification (usually a driver licence or passport)

## Joining KiwiSaver for the first time

If you are not in KiwiSaver yet, you can still use BetterSaver to choose a fund and join online.

We will ask the same quick questions, recommend options from our shortlist, then guide you through joining with your chosen provider.

## Switching KiwiSaver providers

You can switch providers at any time. You are not locked in.

#### What happens when you switch

* Your KiwiSaver stays in your name. You are simply moving it to a new provider and fund.
* Employer contributions usually keep going as normal. In most cases you do not need to tell your employer.
* Government contributions still apply. Switching does not reset anything.
* Your current provider transfers the value of your account to the new provider, then your new provider invests it into the fund you chose.

#### How long it takes

Switching often takes a few business days. Sometimes it can take longer depending on the providers involved. We will show you what to expect during the process so you know what is happening.

#### Is my money out of the market

There is usually a short processing period during a transfer. That is normal for KiwiSaver switches.

## Switching through BetterSaver

#### If your chosen provider supports switching through BetterSaver

This is the smoothest path. The aim is to handle the admin and keep it simple.

* We guide you through the join and switch steps
* You complete it online, in one flow
* We make it clear what happens next and when

#### If your chosen provider does not support switching through BetterSaver

We can still recommend a fund from a provider that does not support switching through our platform, as long as it is on our recommended list and meets our criteria. In most cases, you can still complete the application on the BetterSaver website. We then hand the application over to the provider to finalise the switch. The aim is to keep the signup simple, while being clear about what we can and cannot support ongoing.

What this usually means:

* You can still view the fund and why it is recommended
* You can complete the application on the BetterSaver website, and we pass it to the provider to finalise
* The provider may contact you if they need anything else to complete the switch
* Our ongoing service may be more limited once you are with a non participating provider

## What it costs and how we are paid

Using BetterSaver does not cost you anything extra. You pay the same fund fees you would pay if you went direct to the provider.

BetterSaver may receive a commission from some KiwiSaver providers if you join or switch through our platform. You do not pay this commission directly, and it does not increase your fund fees.

We recommend funds based on our analysis criteria and the information you provide. Our recommended list can include funds that pay us and funds that do not, as long as they meet our criteria and we have enough data to assess them.

For full details, read our Disclosure Statement. 

## Privacy and security

We only use your information to provide recommendations, help you switch, and support you.

We use secure online identity verification so you can switch without printing forms.

##### **Privacy Information**

BetterSaver Limited (we, us, our) complies with the Privacy Act 2020 (the Act) when dealing with personal information. Personal information is information about an identifiable individual (a natural person).

This policy sets out how we will collect, use, disclose and protect your personal information.

This policy does not limit or exclude any of your rights under the Act. If you wish to seek further information on the Act, see [www.privacy.org.nz](http://www.privacy.org.nz).

##### **Changes to this policy**

We may change this policy by uploading a revised policy onto the website. The change will apply from the date that we upload the revised policy.

##### **Who do we collect your personal information from**

We collect personal information about you from:

* you, when you provide that personal information to us, including via the website and any related service, through any registration or subscription process, through any contact with us (e.g. telephone call or email), or when you buy or use our services and products; or
* third parties where you have authorised this or the information is publicly available.

We collect personal information from KiwiSaver managers when you use our KiwiSaver advice service, so that we can provide our services to you.

If possible, we will collect personal information from you directly.

When you provide us with personal information about another person, you must ensure that the person has consented to you providing us with their personal information. You must also ensure that they are aware of the purpose for which the information is being provided, that the information is being provided to us, and that they can contact us to access or correct their information.

If we collect your personal information indirectly (i.e., from a third party), we will take reasonable steps to ensure you are aware of the fact and purpose of the collection, as well as your rights to access and correct your personal information. We may not notify you if you have already been made aware of these details prior to your personal information being provided to us indirectly, or if we believe on reasonable grounds that not notifying you would not prejudice your interests, or where we are otherwise not required to notify you under the Act.

##### **How we use your personal information**

We will use your personal information:

* to verify your identity;
* to provide services and products to you;
* to market our services and products to you, including contacting you electronically (e.g. by text or email for this purpose);
* to improve the services and products that we provide to you;
* to respond to communications from you, including a complaint;
* to conduct research and statistical analysis (on an anonymised basis);
* to protect and/or enforce our legal rights and interests, including defending any claim; or
* for any other purpose authorised by you or permitted under the Act.

##### **Disclosing your personal information**

We may disclose your personal information to:

* another company within our group;
* any business that supports our services and products, including any person that hosts or maintains any underlying IT system or data centre that we use to provide the website or other services and products;
* KiwiSaver managers, so that we can provide our services to you;
* other third parties (for anonymised statistical information);
* a person who can require us to supply your personal information (e.g. a regulatory authority);
* any other person authorised by the Act or another law (e.g. a law enforcement agency); or
* any other person authorised by you.

A business that supports our services and products may be located outside New Zealand. This may mean your personal information may be held and processed outside New Zealand.

When we disclose your personal information to overseas recipients, we ensure that the recipients of your personal information are required to protect it in a way that overall provides comparable safeguards to those in the Act.

##### **Protecting and storing your personal information**

We are committed to protecting the security of your personal information and we take all reasonable precautions to protect it from loss, unauthorised or accidental access, disclosure, alteration, destruction, other misuse and actions that prevent us from accessing your information on a temporary or permanent basis (each event being a Privacy Breach).

We will take reasonable steps to keep your personal information safe from loss, unauthorised activity, or other misuse.

If your personal information is subject to a Privacy Breach that is likely to cause you serious harm, we will notify you and the Privacy Commissioner in accordance with our obligations under the Act.

We will only keep your personal information for as long as we require it for the purpose for which it was collected. However, we may also be required to keep some of your personal information for specified periods of time, for example under certain laws relating to companies, money laundering and financial reporting legislation.

##### **Accessing and correcting your personal information**

You may request access to your personal information held by us, or request that we update or correct any of your personal information held by us, by setting out your request in writing and sending it to us at [contact@bettersaver.co.nz](mailto:contact@bettersaver.co.nz). Your email should provide evidence of who you are and set out the details of your request (e.g. the personal information, or the correction, that you are requesting).

We will review your request as soon as reasonably practicable. If we are unable to give you access to the information you have requested, we will give you reasons for this decision when we respond to your request.

We may charge you our reasonable costs of providing copies of your personal information or correcting that information.

##### **Internet use**

While we take reasonable steps to maintain secure internet connections, if you provide us with personal information over the internet, the provision of that information is at your own risk.

If you post your personal information on the website’s message board or comments section, you acknowledge and agree that the information you post is publicly available.

If you follow a link on our website to another site, the owner of that site will have its own privacy policy relating to your personal information. We suggest you review that site’s privacy policy before you provide personal information.

We use cookies (an alphanumeric identifier that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive so that we can recognise your browser) to monitor your use of the website. The cookies do not, by themselves, personally identify users but may be linked to a database record about users. You may disable cookies by changing the settings on your browser, although this may mean that you cannot use all of the features of the website.

##### **Email and text communications**

We are committed to complying with the Unsolicited Electronic Messages Act 2007.

By subscribing to emails and/or text communications, or otherwise providing your email address and/or mobile number, you consent to receiving emails and/or texts (as the case may be) that promote and market our products and services, or the products and services of others, from time to time.

You can unsubscribe from our email communications and/or text communications at any time by clicking the "Unsubscribe" link in any promotional or marketing email or text received or by emailing [contact@bettersaver.co.nz](mailto:contact@bettersaver.co.nz).

Once you have unsubscribed from our email or text communications, you will be removed from the corresponding marketing list as soon as is reasonably practicable\[AH7.1].

##### P**rivacy Officer**

We take your concerns seriously. If you have any concerns about privacy or the use or collection of your personal information by us, please contact our Privacy Officer at [contact@bettersaver.co.nz](mailto:contact@bettersaver.co.nz).

We will respond as quickly as possible (our target response is 20 working days) and handle all complaints in a way that is fair and consistent. However, if you remain dissatisfied, you can make a formal complaint with Office of the Privacy Commissioner.
